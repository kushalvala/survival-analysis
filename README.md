# Survival Analysis

Generally, Survival Analysis is collection of procedure for analysis for which outcome variable is : *Time until an event  occurs*  \
This set of statistical methods are different from classification algorithms, where we are interested to find patterns among the data, given the labels. \
Here the focus is whether the subject had an outcome of interest but also how *long* it took them to get the *outcome* 

Survival Analysis can be used to explore relations between factors of interest and time to any binary event.
